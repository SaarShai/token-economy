# HANDOFF - token-economy-migration

## 1. Current task

Continue Token Economy framework work from the new canonical local folder `/Users/saar/token-economy`.

## 2. What done

- Original working folder was `/Users/saar/NEW compute 5.5/token-economy`.
- Migrated the repo with git history to `/Users/saar/token-economy`.
- Remote is `https://github.com/SaarShai/token-economy.git`.
- Recent pushed commits before migration include:
  - `04f71a1 Record manual Codex successor verification`
  - `4939bb8 Use fresh successor for legacy Codex summ`
  - `8cace2f Add self-contained Codex summ fallback`
- Durable context-refresh facts were documented in `projects/context-refresh/host-context-controls.md`.

## 3. What in-progress

- The framework needs a cleaned-up context-refresh story:
  - Claude: include a normal `summ` path using native `/clear`.
  - Codex: do not claim current-thread clearing is solved.
  - Codex successor thread launch may remain as a clean-continuation workaround, but it is not the same as clearing the active visible thread.

## 4. What next

1. Start from `/Users/saar/token-economy`.
2. Read `start.md`, `L0_rules.md`, `L1_index.md`, and this handoff only.
3. Review `prompts/summ.md`, `prompts/context-host-controls.md`, `skills/context-refresh/SKILL.md`, and `projects/context-refresh/host-context-controls.md`.
4. Update the framework so Claude `/clear` is the explicit working manual clear path.
5. Reword Codex docs so they distinguish current-thread clear from fresh successor continuation.
6. Remove or mark stale Codex compact instructions that imply `thread/compact/start` is reliable in this environment.

## 5. Key files touched

- `/Users/saar/token-economy/HANDOFF_NEXT_AGENT.md`
- `/Users/saar/token-economy/projects/context-refresh/host-context-controls.md`
- `/Users/saar/token-economy/L1_index.md`
- `/Users/saar/token-economy/HANDOFF.md`

## 6. Key decisions

- Do not continue using `/Users/saar/NEW compute 5.5/token-economy` as the active local working folder.
- Use `/Users/saar/token-economy` going forward.
- Do not include the long failed Codex prompt-testing transcript in future context.
- Treat Codex current-thread clear as unsolved unless a future test proves otherwise.
- Treat Claude `/clear` as the practical manual clear path.

## 7. Wiki pages updated

- `[[projects/context-refresh/host-context-controls]]`

## 8. Open questions

- Should the Codex App Server successor helper remain in the framework as an optional workaround, or be moved to experiments only?
- Should `./te context codex-compact-thread` be removed, hidden, or labelled experimental because current-thread compact failed in this environment?

## 9. Instructions for next agent

- Start in plan mode. Think step-by-step.
- Work only in `/Users/saar/token-economy`.
- Do not load the old Codex context-clearing transcript.
- Make small, scoped documentation/code updates.
- Run focused tests after edits.
- Commit and push from `/Users/saar/token-economy` when done.
