# Token Economy

A repo-local framework for reducing LLM token/compute consumption while preserving capability.

## Universal agent start

Give any AI agent [`start.md`](start.md). It provides the lean operating contract: Caveman Ultra, repo-local markdown wiki memory, progressive retrieval, 20% context refresh, and model-aware delegation.

Core commands:

```bash
./te doctor
./te wiki search "topic"
./te context status
./te context codex-fresh-thread --handoff <handoff-file>
./te delegate classify "task"
./te pa --directive "/pa quick context-light request"
./te output-filter stats
./te output-filter rewind
```

Config lives in [`token-economy.yaml`](token-economy.yaml). Agent-specific adapters live in [`adapters/`](adapters/).

Supplemental productization:

```bash
./te wiki new --template page --title "New Memory"
./te wiki lint --strict
./te context meter --transcript session.jsonl
./te hooks doctor
./te profile show
./te bench run --suite framework-smoke
```

Skills, prompts, hooks, configs, templates, and optional extension recipes live in their matching top-level folders.

For manual context refresh, use [`prompts/summ.md`](prompts/summ.md). Copy-paste prompts are available for the old session ([`prompts/manual-summ-document-and-handoff.md`](prompts/manual-summ-document-and-handoff.md)) and fresh session ([`prompts/manual-fresh-session-from-handoff.md`](prompts/manual-fresh-session-from-handoff.md)). For full project migration, use [`prompts/manual-full-summ.md`](prompts/manual-full-summ.md) in the old project and [`prompts/manual-import-full-summ.md`](prompts/manual-import-full-summ.md) in the fresh Token Economy folder. In Codex, current-thread clear/compact is unsolved in the tested Desktop/App Server environment; `./te context codex-compact-thread` is experimental. Use `./te context codex-fresh-thread --handoff <handoff-file> --execute` for a persistent fresh successor thread with only `start.md` plus the handoff. This is clean continuation, not clearing the old visible thread. For older project installs that lack those subcommands, use [`prompts/summ-codex-manual.md`](prompts/summ-codex-manual.md), which skips fragile same-thread compacting and directly launches a persistent fresh successor through App Server.

## TL;DR — key measured results

- **ComCom**: 44.9% input-token cut, quality preserved (Δ score −0.12 with 95% CI touching 0). Works via 3-stage escalation: compressed → verify → retry or fall back.
- **semdiff**: 19,280 → 859 tokens on argparse.py after 2 method edits (95.5%). 99.5% on stable re-read.
- **context-keeper**: extracts 68 files, 21 commands, 21 errors from a 100-turn transcript into a grep-able markdown page before `/compact`.
- **output-filter**: strips ANSI/progress noise, deduplicates adjacent lines, preserves errors, stores raw output under `.token-economy/output-filter/`, and exposes `stats`/`rewind`.

## Quick start (per tool)

### ComCom (compound compression)

```python
from pipeline_v2 import compress
from verify import escalate_gen

# Adaptive mode — recommended for personal use
def my_gen(ctx):
    # your model-call wrapper; returns answer string
    return call_model(prompt=build_prompt(ctx, question))

answer, meta = escalate_gen(question, context, my_gen,
                             rates=(0.5, 0.7, None))
# meta: {rate_used, attempts, total_verify_tokens, grounded}
```

### semdiff (AST-diff file reads)

MCP server, works with Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, Zed, any MCP client. See [projects/semdiff/INSTALL.md](projects/semdiff/INSTALL.md).

```bash
# Example MCP client
claude mcp add semdiff -- python /path/to/semdiff/semdiff_mcp/server.py
```

### context-keeper (PreCompact memory)

Context-keeper writes session memory under repo-local `.token-economy/` paths by default. Do not configure global agent settings unless a human explicitly requests machine-wide behavior outside this framework.

### output-filter (terminal noise)

The hook at `hooks/output-filter/filter.sh` keeps filtered terminal output short while preserving raw output locally for debugging:

```bash
some noisy command | TOKEN_ECONOMY_ROOT="$PWD" hooks/output-filter/filter.sh
./te output-filter stats
./te output-filter rewind
./te output-filter rules --init
```

Custom rules live at `.token-economy/output-filter-rules.txt` by default. Use `keep:<regex>`, `drop:<regex>`, and `collapse:<regex>`. Session-aware suppression is available with `--session-aware` or `output_filter_session_aware: true`, but remains opt-in because repeated lines can be meaningful during debugging.

## Wiki

The `Token Economy` folder doubles as a repo-local markdown LLM wiki. See [index.md](index.md), [schema.md](schema.md).

Folders:
- `concepts/` — atomic technique pages
- `patterns/` — reusable workflows
- `projects/` — our builds
- `raw/` — immutable source material (research notes, surveys)
- `people/` — referenced humans
- `queries/` — durable Q&A
- `sessions/` — auto-generated by context-keeper

## Status

This is active research. Interfaces may change. Evals are small-N; see each project's RESULTS for limitations.
