# Skills — Rated Index

All 11 measured skills, rated on efficiency, gain, reliability, and quality loss. (`index-first` and `loop-breaker` added v1.4.0 — eval pending; `loop-breaker` targets a tail failure mode so standard A/B will under-represent the effect — see [`loop-breaker/EVAL.md`](../skills/loop-breaker/EVAL.md) for the measurement plan. `eval-gate` added v1.6.0 — opt-in, eval pending; its claim is defect-catch-rate, not token savings, so it won't fit this efficiency table — see [`eval-gate/EVAL.md`](../skills/eval-gate/EVAL.md).)
Static columns are deterministic. Live columns require a live A/B run via `eval/runner.py`.

### Rating scale

- **Efficiency**: net token savings (output cut weighted high, input cost weighted low). A ≥ 60%, B ≥ 30%, C ≥ 10%, D ≥ 0, F < 0.
- **Gain**: percentage output-token reduction when the skill is loaded. A ≥ 60%, B ≥ 30%, C ≥ 10%, D ≥ 0, F < 0 (worse).
- **Reliability**: qualitative, based on body length + bundled tools + EVAL.md presence. A = comprehensive, F = minimal.
- **Quality loss**: Δjudge score from A/B (negative = worse). A = 0 or positive, B ≥ −0.25, C ≥ −0.5, D ≥ −1.0, F < −1.0.

`?` = pending live measurement.

## What the columns mean

- **desc tok**: always-resident description size; sum across the catalog = the context tax for having the skill available.
- **body tok**: skill protocol size; loaded only when the skill triggers.
- **Δin%**: change in input tokens per call with the skill loaded (positive = skill adds context cost).
- **Δout%**: change in output tokens per call (negative = skill makes output tighter — usually what we want).
- **Δjudge**: change in judge quality score (0–5 scale).
- **N**: live-run sample size.

## Notes

- **caveman-ultra, lean-execution, plan-first-execute, verify-before-completion**: in-context A/B (`eval/runner.py`). Δout% is output-token reduction per call.
- **prompt-triage**: end-to-end routing A/B (`eval/runner_triage.py`). Δout% maps to **delta_total_pct** — total input+output tokens summed across the corpus when the cheap/expensive router is active.
- **context-keeper**: fidelity test (`eval/runner_keeper.py`), not a per-call A/B. Δout% maps to **compression of the extracted sidecar vs. the raw transcript** — the sidecar at 2.3% of raw size IS the value, since it survives compaction and the raw transcript usually doesn't. See its `EVAL.md` for per-category recall (URLs 100%, numbers 67%, commands 46%, errors 25%).
- **handoff, context-refresh, output-filter, wiki-memory, delegate, compress-context, semantic-diff**: live measurement pending. See each skill's `EVAL.md` for the methodology and any prior numbers.
- Hook skills (`prompt-triage`, `context-keeper`, `output-filter`) do NOT prepend to the system message in normal use; their cost is the hook script's transcript footprint, not in-context tokens.
- A `?` in any column means the live A/B hasn't been run for that skill yet; the static cost is always populated.
